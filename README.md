# Memory Allocator Project
A simple implementation of a memory allocator in C. This project demonstrates basic concepts of memory management, including block allocation, freeing, and coalescing adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.

# Features
  - Custom Memory Management: Simulates a simple memory allocator with a fixed-size memory pool.
  - First-Fit Allocation Strategy: Allocates memory using the first available block large enough to fit the requested size.
  - Block Coalescing: Merges adjacent free blocks to minimize fragmentation.
